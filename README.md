# About

This side-project was created in the goal of solving the extremely annoying problem with [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) playlists shrinking out of nowhere with no information provided about what was previously stored in there. Remember those jams you used to listen to back in 2016-17 ? Throughout the years, videos get privated or deleted, channels get banned and you're left with that brief memory of a song that you'd like to listen to out of no where yet you can't find it anymore. This simple extension uses [Filmot](https://filmot.com/)'s API to find metadata based on the video ids and re-populates the placeholders with information helping you find that song or video again.
